        <p  class="containerA">
		&ensp; I am Schuyler Bridges, a junior Information Technology Major at KSU. I am originally from Texas but when I turned 12 I move to Washington. While there I pursued
		programming courses as electives through middle and high school. In my junior year of high school I joined the Running Start program (similar to Georgia's Dual Enrollment)
		and received my Associates Degree in the Arts and Sciences before I graduated high school. Aside from coursework I was also a part of a local film group, formerly known
		as The Griff on youtube (has since been renamed), as well as a crew member for our schools theatre department.
        <br>
		<br>
		&ensp; Now that I am officially in college I am a software member for the Electric Vehicle Team at KSU and a sister of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority, for which I am part of 
		2 committees; COB and Ritual. I am set to complete my degree in Fall of 2025 as I took a gap year between my high school graduation and my start at KSU, partially to move 
		but also to save money in order to actually go to college. I am also currently working on getting my CompTIA A+ certification this summer and I plan to get the Microsoft Fundamentals
		and CompTIA Security+ certifications before I graduate.
		<br>
		<br>
		&ensp; Once out of college I plan to move overseas, either to New Zealand, Sweden, or Norway. I would like to find a remote job in Cybersecurity. Specifically, 
		I would like to pursue a career as a Penetration Tester, Cybersecurity Engineer, or a Forensic Computer Analyst. Of course it will take time before I manage to land these
		sorts of positions but I plan to continue improving and learning as much as I can. Aside from career goals, I would also like to start my own crotechet business to make a little bit
		of extra money while I'm still in college. I plan to sell crotchet flowers and stuffed animals.
